<h1> Hello <code>&lt;/World!&gt;</code> </h1>

I'm just a guy who has been into technology since I was a kid, starting from destroying random system files on my parents' PC, playing too much Halo, discovering the consequences of downloading RAM, and even inserting an [arepa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arepa) into a DVD because it looked like a CD.

Nowadays, I enjoy working on side projects based on random ideas I get from time to time for fun. Feel free to check them outâ€”I'm sure you'll find one you like!
